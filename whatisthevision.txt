what is the vision?


wallpaper generator
    - i want it to be dynamic, if possible
    - based on weather/location
    - i feel like news state is more interesting

        - sentiment analysis
    

    -how are we actually generating these wallpapers?



    there's a dynamic wallpaper engine which is pretty cool here:
        https://github.com/zzag/plasma5-wallpapers-dynamic/tree/main
        take a look!
        (it doesn't work.)
